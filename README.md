### Scope

The quiz consists of twenty questions, each with four multiple choice options. There will be no timer or any limits to number of times it can be attempted. The submit button will return whether the selected answer was correct and explain the lore behind the correct answer so users may learn about the world of Runeterra bit by bit. The score at the end will be calculated as a percentage with each question having a weighted value of 1/20. 

### Structure

The landing page will offer an introduction explaining the purpose of the quiz and instructions on how to proceed with a "ready" button that can be clicked when the user is ready. Clicking on the logo at any time will take users to this landing page.

Everytime the "submit answer" button is clicked, an alert will inform the user whether the answer was correct or not, along with an explanation of the lore behind the correct answer. The user can simply press the okay button on the alert box to proceed to the next question. 

A selection does not need to be made for the quiz to proceed but clicking "submit answer" without choosing a response will be considered an incorrect response. It will still prompt the alert to return the correct answer with the lore explanation so the user learns information no matter what. 

A "restart quiz" button beside the "submit answer" button remains throughout the entirety of the quiz so users can start from the beginning whenever they wish. It will restart the progress bar and reset the score. 

A progress bar below the submit and restart buttons allows users to have steady reminders of how far along they are.  

On clicking "submit answer" after the final question, the quiz area text will be replaced with the external link to the league of legends website (which opens in a new tab), the "restart quiz" button will remain and the score will be displayed below with custom messages depending on the score.
